# DC Motor Control Systems Repository

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the development of a DC motor model and the design of control systems for this model. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing control systems for DC motors.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains:

- Code snippets implementing the temporal evolution of the system using ARMA models.
- Implementation of PID and Full State Feedback control systems.
- Plot to better understand the behavior and characteristics of these control systems.

## Why DC Motor Control Systems?

DC motors are fundamental components in many applications, from robotics to industrial systems. Understanding how to control these motors is crucial for efficient and effective system performance. By practicing with these control systems, I aim to deepen my understanding and improve my skills in control system design.
